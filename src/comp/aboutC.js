        I am an aspiring UX/UI and interaction designer. I am currently enrolled in BCITâ€™s Digital Design and Development program, where I have developed a strong foundation in creating interactive and dynamic applications and websites. <br /> <br />

        I am fuelled by my curiosity, which is what sparked my interest in UX. I am always eager to learn new things and my curiosity is what drives me to find solutions to everyday problems.<br /> <br />

        I have taken on numerous side projects such as designing and creating websites and posters for startups based in the Philippines. These projects have helped my with my skills in design, HTML, CSS, and WordPress.
