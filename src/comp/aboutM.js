            Help Cityfone to structure the project of building four websites, from UX strategy to visual design and assets delivery, taking into account stakeholders, business, and userâ€™s needs.  <br />
        
            The project resulted in satisfied customers giving voluntary feedbacks on the NPS score research about how easy is to use the website, and find the information they need, compared to other websites. The first online sale of the company came just a couple of hours after the launching and it follows growing.
